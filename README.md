# Week 2: Waste Classification Project

## Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (Jan 2025 - Feb 2025)

### Project Overview
This project is part of the *Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship* program, spanning four weeks from *January 2025 to February 2025. The primary objective of this project is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* model to classify images of waste into different categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images categorized into different classes and is used for training and validation.

## What I Did in This Project

### Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
- Performed data cleaning and augmentation to enhance the dataset's quality and diversity.

### Model Development:
- Built a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* model using *TensorFlow* and *Keras*.
- Configured the model architecture with multiple *convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers* to effectively capture features from the images.

### Model Training:
- Split the dataset into *training* and *validation* sets.
- Trained the CNN model on the training set and validated its performance on the validation set.
- Utilized techniques such as *early stopping* and *learning rate scheduling* to optimize the training process.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as *accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score*.
- Visualized the model's performance through *confusion matrices* and *classification reports*.

### Results and Analysis:
- Analyzed the model's predictions and identified areas for improvement.
- Documented the findings and insights gained from the project.

## Repository Structure
- *README.md*: Project overview and documentation.
- *wasteclassification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for **data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation*.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable *hands-on experience* in developing and deploying a *CNN model* for image classification tasks. The skills and knowledge gained from this project will be instrumental in future *machine learning* and *data science* endeavors.
