# Week 1: Waste Classification Project

## Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (Jan 2025 - Feb 2025)

### Project Overview
This project is part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship program, which spans four weeks from January 2025 to February 2025. The primary objective of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into different categories.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data). It contains images of plastic waste categorized into different classes.

### What I Did in This Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
   - Performed data cleaning and augmentation to enhance the dataset's quality and diversity.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Configured the model architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to effectively capture features from the images.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Trained the CNN model on the training set and validated its performance on the validation set.
   - Utilized techniques such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize the training process.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized the model's performance through confusion matrices and classification reports.

5. **Results and Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the model's predictions and identified areas for improvement.
   - Documented the findings and insights gained from the project.
